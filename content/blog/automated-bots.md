# What are you talking about?

>>> Well I drove down to Big D.C.
And I walked into Room 1003
And there they were The Big Boys.
And they were talking Big B Little O Little M Silent B
They were saying: '''Let's teach those robots how to play hardball.
Let's teach those little fellas a little gratitude.'''
-> Laurie Anderson, ''Sharkey's Night'', Home of the Brave, 1985

I've been writing bots for a while now. Some are still running.

I thought about this for over a year, until somebody goaded me into [actualizing a joke](http://bbs.boingboing.net/t/comprehensively-addressing-the-stupid-intellectually-dishonest-critique-of-anita-sarkeesian/40229/139).

I started out with Google-spreadhsheet-script bots, and "graduated" to NodeJs bots running on Heroku.

I have some ideas for future bots, but who knows. These things are fun, programming exercises, linguistic exercises, artistic expressions, artistic experiments, autistic experiments, and whoknowswhat.

Bots that use Tracery/[Cheap Bots Done Quick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) may have some source and notes @ <https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/tracery-grammars>
