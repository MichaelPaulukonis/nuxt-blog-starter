Warhol's screen-prints led me to think how \"text\" is almost infinitely repeatable, and thus not a comodity, like a painting or a print could be. That led me down many roads with physical concrete poetry, typewriters and text paintings. Rothko is perhaps a more oblique influence, but he was me entree to color-field painting, and how several of my college classmates couldn't stand abstract paintings like that - their irritated descriptions filled me with a desire to create something similarly monolithic.
